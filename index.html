					I’m pretty sure it’s a scientific fact that no human being can resist a kitten. Those little toes! The
					big eyes! And
					don’t get me started on the whiskers. Kittens have been stealing hearts since forever. It doesn’t matter
					if it’s a cute
					calico kitten swatting at your hair or a tabby taking a nap in your favorite slipper, kittens of all
					colors are
					adorable. Kittens stay kittens for only a few months, but those months are filled with silly antics and a
					lot of
					memorable moments.</p>

					1. A kitten’s whiskers are as long as their body is wide.</h5>
				<p>One of the first things you’ll notice when looking at a kitten’s face are their whiskers. Kittens are
					tiny little
					things, but their whiskers are pretty impressive. They grow to be as wide as their bodies are wide to
					help them navigate
					the world. This is especially helpful for young kittens that are still getting used to working all their
					limbs.
				</p>



				<h5>2. All kittens are born with blue eyes.</h5>
				<p>A kitten’s eyes are definitely on the list of their cutest attributes. All kittens have pretty blue eyes
					when they’re
					born. As they grow, their eye color continues to develop. For a lot of kittens, this means their eyes
					change color. Even
					cats with dark eyes once had blue peepers.</p>


				<h5>3. Newborn kittens can purr.</h5>
				<p>When kittens are first born, there are a lot of things they can’t do. They can’t see or walk around, for
					example. That’s
					because they still have a bit of development to get through. But one thing they can do really well is
					purr. You can
					often hear brand new kittens purr the first time they nurse with mom.</p>


				<h5>4. Kittens are blind and mostly deaf until they’re 2-3 weeks old.</h5>
				<p>Kittens open their eyes for the first time when they’re around one week old. But even then, they can
					barely see. They
					also can’t hear clearly. They’re completely dependent on their mom during this time.</p>


				<h5>5. Kittens only weigh 3-4 ounces at birth.</h5>
				<p>Newborns are incredibly tiny. Even the heftiest babies only weigh about the same as a small lemon. They
					do a lot of
					growing in the first few weeks of life.
				</p>



				<h5>6. Kittens can’t regulate their body temperature.</h5>
				<p>When kittens are still in their tiny stage of development, they can’t generate and regulate body heat
					like mature
					mammals. This leaves them extremely vulnerable to the cold. They need to snuggle up close to mom and
					their siblings to
					keep warm. If you ever find an abandoned baby all on their own, your first concern should be making sure
					they’re warm.</p>
